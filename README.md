# About

Using the REST API I made for Jeopardy clues (found [here](https://github.com/rrosenlof/jeopardy-api)), this simple [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) site shows a random clue, used in an episode of Jeopardy. A work in progress, but you can check it out here: https://jeopardy-clues.netlify.app/

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add details about the clues
- [ ] Return all clues for a random category
- [ ] Flag errors in clues if needed (i.e. clue requires visual component, errors in spelling/punctuation, missing parts)
- [ ] Allow user to enter answer, check if right, keep a running point tally
